# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Dorcas Misango


## Dataset

>The dataset, Ford GoBike System Data, includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It is downloaded from Ford GoBike and licensed by Ford GoBike. This dataset includes 183,412 trips with 16 features such as station names, duration and user attributes. There are start and end stations. I noticed that this dataset included trips that only occured in the second month(February). Thus, the following analysis is performed by this subsetted dataset.



## Summary of Findings

>**Univariate exploration:** Most trips lasted for about 4-6 minutes and very few were longer than an hour.The number of trips gradually decreases during the later hours(after 7pm). During the day, there are more trips in the morning and evening. Also, there are more trips during the weekdays and less trips during the weekends. Subscribers had more trips than the customers as seen after exploration. For the gender groups, the number of trips in male riders is 3 times more than the number of trips in females. Most of riders are in thier thirties as compared to other age groups. The top stations with the highest number of riders were  Market St at 10th St and San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St)

>**Bivariate exploration:** Subscribers and customers mostly rode bikes early in the morning at 8am or in the evening at 5pm, however the subscribers were more than the customers. Both groups had their trips mostly on Thursdays. Males followed by females mostly rode bikes early in the morning at 8am or in the evening at 5pm as compared to the other gender. All the groups had their trips mostly on Thursdays. The most popular station( Market St at 10th St) had the most traffic on Thursday. the other top stations also hasd the most traffic on either Tuesday or Thursday. On average rides from Monday to Sunday, Tuesday had the day with the shortest duration minutes while Saturday was the day with the highest average time spent riding the bikes. On average rides on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) lasted longer than the other days.
Biking definetly has a correlation to the location, time and user attributes.

>**Multivariate exploration:** Subscriber and Customer rides lasted longer on Saturday and Sunday. We can see that customer rides lasted longer than subscriber rides. Subscriber and Customer had longer rides at 2 or 3 am.This could be because the bikes rented at this time were probably returned the next day. On average customers rides lasted longer than subscribers rides at every hour of the day.
Male, Female and other rides lasted longer on Sunday. We can see that on average, other rides lasted longer than male and female rides. Other and females had longer rides at 2 or 3 am. On average other rides lasted longer than male and female rides at most hours of the day (except at 9-10 am and at 6pm).
All the rides seem to last longer on the weekend as compared to other days

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The stations with the most trips are located in San Francisco . User types and the member gender play a key factor on the number of trips in each location and time group. Customer rides lasted longer than subscriber rides especially on weekends. however subscibers went on more trips copared to the customers.The other gender had longer trips compared to males and females especially on the weekends. However we can see that the males went on more rides as compared to females and others. Most trips were traken by people in their thirties.
> Location, User type,Age and Gender play a key role in the number of rides and the duration of each ride.
